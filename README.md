# Personal encounterd in the project.

Having to work on this project in a constrained time frame really put me a bit on the edge and i wished i had more time so that i can give the best of my craft. But all the same it was cool and was worth the hard work.

In as much as i had fun working on this sample project, I had some issue on understanding what exactly was required of me to do on the "White-Labeling" part and also on the "categories (free text input) and
business models (free text input)", i wish i had some one that could explain what i was expected to deliver.

I was able to finish the part i understood within the 6hr time frame.

And i thank you for the opportunity and the challenge.
